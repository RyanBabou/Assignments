# Assignment 3
## task
1. The most important part of this the N which means that the time moves linearly which means that the steps increase in porportion with the input size. both the 4 and the +16 are constant and the don't effect linear groqwth.
2. The most important part of this the N^2 which means that we have a quadratic time which basically means if the input doubles the steps grow 4 times more. the 2 is a constant and it doesn't affect overall growth.
3. The following function goes through the array twice. The first loop double every element and the second loop adds them all together. Even thought there's two loops one runs after the other. That means the time mgrows linearly which means the complexity is O(N).
4. In the following function every string gets processed three times upcase, lowcase, and capitalize. Even though it's three moves happening, these moves are all constant and the number of steps grows in porportion with the number of strings which means the complexity is O(N).
5. In the function the outer loop goes through all the numbers in the array as for the inner loop it only runs through when the index is even which about half of the elements in the array. The inner loop goes through the array again everytime it loops. it gives us 1/2 (N*N) which is basically representative of the quadratic time which is O(N^2)
