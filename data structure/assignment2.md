# Assignment 2
## Task 
1. How many steps would it take to perform a linear search for the number 8 in the ordered array, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13]?
   it takes 4 steps to perform a linear search for the number 8 in the ordered array.
2. How many steps would binary search take for the previous example?
   it would take 2 steps for the binaery search to take for the previous example.
3. What is the maximum number of steps it would take to perform a binary search on an array of size 100,000?
   it would take 17 steps as maximum number of steps it would take to perform a binary search on an array of size 100,000
4. Write a C++ code that implements the linear and binary search algorithms. The algorithm should be able to calculate the number of steps against the given search?
